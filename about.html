                  <h2> Engineers at Facebook, while working on designing the different complex Facebook apps, realized that the declarative style of coding would make their app organization easy.
                    They developed a new programming language called JSX and a new mobile development framework called React Native to help build powerful and complex apps in an easy way.
                    JSX combines both HTML and Javascript style of coding. JSX is declarative - we tell what are
                    the different components we want in the application
